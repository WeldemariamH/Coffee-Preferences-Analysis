# Coffee-Preferences-Analysis

Welcome to the Coffee Preferences Analysis repository! This project delves into the intricate world of coffee preferences, utilizing a structured tabular survey dataset sourced from Kaggle. The data has undergone meticulous cleaning and preprocessing in Excel before being subjected to in-depth exploration and feature engineering in Python. The analysis includes statistical insights, word clouds, and frequency distributions, providing a comprehensive understanding of the surveyed coffee preferences.And PowerBi visualization has been produced to reveal the findings.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis captures the diverse preferences of coffee enthusiasts, covering a range of parameters such as amount of coffee consumptions, roast levels, strength preferences, and more. The data's journey begins with careful cleaning and curation in Excel, ensuring its readiness for deeper analytical exploration.

## Python Analysis

The Python analysis segment of the project involves thorough exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing steps, followed by feature engineering to extract meaningful insights. Statistical analyses are performed to generate word clouds and frequency distributions, shedding light on prominent patterns within the dataset. The processed data is then exported as an Excel file, acting as the bridge between Python and Power BI.

### Steps in Python:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Importation of the data into Python.
   - Implementation of necessary cleaning and preprocessing procedures.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creation of new columns to enrich the dataset.

3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Conducting statistical analysis to generate word clouds and frequency distributions.

4. **Export to Excel:**
   - Exporting the processed data as an Excel file for seamless integration with Power BI.

## Power BI Visualization

The journey through data analysis continues with Power BI, where the Excel file is transformed into visually compelling insights. The result is two distinct pages, each housing three powerful visualizations, providing a captivating narrative about coffee preferences.

### Page One: Coffee Preferences Demystified

1. **Hotspots of Coffee Consumption: A Gender and Age Perspective**
   - Visualization showcasing the place where coffee usually consumed with a gender and age perspective.

2. **Demystifying the Coffee Cup: Exploring Reasons Behind Consumption (Gender and Age Perspective)**
   - Visualization exploring the reasons behind coffee consumption, considering gender and age perspectives.

3. **Coffee Personalizations: Exploring Additions and Preferences**
   - Visualization illustrating personalizations and additions people make to their coffee.

4. **Analyzing the Number of Coffee Cups Consumed per day Across Age Ranges**
   - Visualization providing insights into the number of coffee cups consumed per day across different age ranges.

### Page Two: Coffee Preferences Explored

1. **Coffee Palette: Favorite Coffee Across Age and Gender**
   - Visualization showcasing favorite coffee types across age and gender.

2. **Charting Roast Preferences Across Generations and Gender**
   - Visualization exploring roast level preferences across different Age groups and genders.

3. **Unveiling Coffee Strength Preferences Across Age and Gender**
   - Visualization revealing preferences for coffee strength across age groups and genders.
